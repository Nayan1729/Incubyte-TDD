# 🧪 String Calculator Kata - Test Driven Development (TDD)

Welcome to the **String Calculator Kata**, a TDD-driven Java implementation completed as part of the **Incubyte Campus Placement Round**.

This project follows the classic kata introduced by [Roy Osherove](http://osherove.com/kata), showcasing **Test-Driven Development**, clean coding, and comprehensive JUnit testing.

## 📘 What is TDD?

**Test-Driven Development as mentioned by Uncle Bob (TDD)** is a development technique where you:

1. ✍️ Write a failing test first  
2. 🛠️ Write the minimal code to make the test pass  
3. 🔄 Refactor the code while keeping tests green  

It follows this powerful cycle:

> 🔁 **Failed → Passed → Refactor**

## 📐 How I Built This Project

This project was built incrementally, respecting TDD principles step-by-step:

- 🚦 Started with the **simplest test** for an empty string
- 🧪 Added tests one at a time for each new rule or requirement
- 🧹 Refactored after each passing test
- 💡 Never wrote unnecessary logic before the test demanded it

## 🧪 Testing

JUnit is used as the primary testing framework.

Test coverage includes:

- All edge cases
- Negative numbers
- Large numbers
- Delimiters (default, custom, multi-char, multiple)

> 🔍 All tests are located in `StringCalculatorTest.java`

To run tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

## Credits & Thanks

Thanks to **Roy Osherove** for the kata and **Incubyte** for the opportunity to explore TDD in real-world scenarios.

This was a great exercise in writing clean, modular, and testable code with a purpose.

With appreciation,
